                    <p><strong>ABOUT</strong></p>
<p>BRAINEFFECT is one of the fastest-growing mind nutrition e-commerce companies in Germany. We envision a world that embraces mind nutrition and knows that feeding your mind is key to a happy and healthy life.</p>
<p>Our international team is ambitious. Together we are working hard to turn the food industry around with Mind Nutrition and make BRAINEFFECT the absolute Love Brand.</p>
<p>How do we do that? By practicing what we preach: We are focused and bring our full energy to every project with a strong results-oriented mindset. While bold goals and growth drive us, we also recognize the importance of balance and recovery to maintain a sustainable pace. Above all - we actually look forward to Monday mornings.</p>
<p><strong>IN A NUTSHELL</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for a data-oriented growth leader who knows how to scale D2C brands beyond the €200k/month ad spend mark — without losing sight of ROAS, CAC, LTV and the bigger P&#x26;L picture.</p>
<p>As our <strong>Head of Growth &#x26; Performance Marketing</strong>, you take ownership of paid growth across our markets. You lead and develop your team, break through scaling plateaus, bring clarity to ambiguity, and turn creative insights into high-converting campaigns.</p>
<p>You report directly to our CMO and act as the bridge between Data, Creative, Finance, and Logistics. If you think in funnels, dream in dashboards, and treat performance dips like a personal challenge — this one’s for you.</p>
<h2>YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
<ul>
<li>You own and scale the ad budget across Meta, Google, Amazon, TikTok &#x26; emerging channels with full ROAS/CAC/LTV responsibility.</li>
<li>You develop a holistic cross-channel strategy where Social drives demand and Search captures it.</li>
<li>You stabilize and reduce CAC through systematic, high-volume creative testing frameworks.</li>
<li>You deep-dive into GA4 and attribution tools (e.g. Adtribute, Tracify) to model the customer journey and drive smarter budget allocation.</li>
<li>You build and maintain automated BI dashboards (Looker Studio or similar) and translate data into actionable insights for the C-suite.</li>
<li>You test and scale new growth channels together with external agencies.</li>
<li>You lead, mentor and challenge your team to think beyond channel silos and act as business owners.</li>
</ul>
<h2>YOUR PROFILE</h2>
<ul>
<li>6+ years in Performance Marketing within fast-moving D2C brands, including 4+ years leading a team.</li>
<li>Proven experience managing 6 figure monthly ad spend with strong focus on blended performance metrics.</li>
<li>Deep expertise in bidding algorithms, auction dynamics, creative testing, and cross-channel attribution.</li>
<li>Advanced skills in GA4, attribution tools, Excel/G-Sheets (Pivot, Index/Match, modeling) and Looker Studio (or similar BI tools).</li>
<li>Hands-on mindset: Able to independently create or iterate ads using tools like Canva, CapCut or Adobe.</li>
<li>Experience in DACH or FR markets, German is a plus.</li>
<li>Highly analytical with strong commercial acumen — you connect channel metrics to total P&#x26;L impact.</li>
<li>Proactive, ownership-driven leader with strong communication skills across Data, Creative and Finance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>YOUR BENEFITS</h2>
<ul>
<li>We work in a hybrid mode (remote + office) and have flexible working hours.</li>
<li>We offer a company pension plan and support you with an allowance of 15%</li>
<li>We will subsidize your Urban Sports Club membership and lunch.</li>
<li>We guarantee 100% ownership, 100% trust and 0% micro management for you and your work style.</li>
<li>We regularly organize company lunches, yoga and sports sessions and parties.</li>
<li>We offer really good employee discounts on our products.</li>
<li>The best part: We offer our employees an annual "jobbatical" that lets you extend your vacation in the sun simply by continuing to work remotely.</li>
